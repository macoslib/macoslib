###About
This is the MacOSLib project for Xojo (formerly Real Studio) (http://www.xojo.com)

It provides additional OS X specific functionality that Xojo's own framework doesn't offer.

It even has some cross-platform functionality in order to access Mac specific data on Windows and Linux (e.g. plist files).

###How to use

If you've downloaded the zip file, double-click the macoslib.rbvcp file to open it in the Xojo IDE. This is a project containing lots of examples, modules and macoslib itself. Run the project and play with the examples (see menu bar) to find out all the things you can do with it.

Now, to use that power in your own apps, you need to copy the macoslib folder in the Navigator (the list on the left hand side of Xojo) - don't copy it from the Finder, it won't work. Next, open your own project and paste the folder in. Now you can access MacOSLib's functionality.
