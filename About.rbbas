		- Implemented all the ImageCaptureCore Cocoa classes to detect and manage cameras, iPhones and iPods. They are lower-level than
		     their ImageKit counterparts (introduced in v.107), i.e. more powerful but more difficult to implement. ImageCapture includes the following classes: ICDeviceBrowser,
		     ICDevice (children ICCameraDevice and ICScannerDevice), ICCameraItem (children ICCameraFolder, ICCameraFile). Some functions like deletion and uploading are
		     not available.
		     Scanner objects are not implemented.
		- Added a License note in the About module (the license terms were only available on the website)

		- Partially implemented ImageCaptureCore classes necessary to support ImageKit (ICDevice, ICScannerDevice, ICCameraDeviceâ€¦). They should not be used at the moment.
