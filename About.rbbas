		Original sources are located here:  https://github.com/macoslib/macoslib
		
		Requires REALbasic 2007r4 or later and MacOS X 10.5 or later.

	#tag Note, Name = Documentation
		The macoslib documentation is provided inside macoslib itself as described at http://ufos-software.com/docgen/
		
		Eventually, Docgen (1) will be able to export the full documentation of macoslib
		
		
		
		
		
		(1) "Docgen" is a codename. The final software name has not been chosen yet.

	#tag Note, Name = How To Use
		To add MacOSLib to your project, select the entire "macoslib" folder in this project, copy it and paste
		it into your project. Do not attempt to import (or drag+drop) the folder from disk into your project,
		as the IDE will mess the class hierarchy up, causing lots of compile errors.
		
		If you find that the macoslib is too large for your needs, don't worry - the compiler will only include
		the code for classes you actually use in your project, so your project won't grow just because you include
		macoslib without using any of its features (well, that's the theory, at least).
		
		You may try to remove unused classes and modules gradually after you figure out you won't need them,
		but please start with the entire macoslib folder to save you trouble initially.

		     not available.
